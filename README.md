# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of errors within asynchronous route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation might fail without a robust mechanism to gracefully handle this failure.  This can lead to unexpected server crashes or silent failures, impacting application stability and reliability.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation.  It demonstrates how to use `async/await` and proper error handling within `try...catch` blocks to manage potential errors effectively. This ensures that even if an asynchronous operation fails, the application remains responsive and provides appropriate error messages to users or logs detailed error information for debugging.

## Key Improvements in the Solution:

* **Error Handling:** A comprehensive `try...catch` block is used to capture and handle errors during asynchronous operations.
* **Clear Error Messages:** The solution provides informative error messages for both development and production environments.
* **Robustness:** The app remains stable even when facing unexpected exceptions.
